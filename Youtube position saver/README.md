# Youtube position saver

Userscript by agj. Works on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).

It will periodically save the current position of the video you're watching, so that if the page gets reloaded you won't lose your position. The way the position is saved is on the URL itself (the `t=1234` part of it).
